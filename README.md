# Learning OpenGL
This is a project depicting my journey learning OpenGL and C++. In the end I hope to create a minecraft clone with this, using concepts like Perlin noise and occlusion culling to improve performance.

## Dependencies

The dependencies of this project is glew, glfw, and imgui which can be installed from your distro's package manager. If you're on Windows or Mac, good luck.
